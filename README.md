# tappy-chicken
An Extended (with AI) Version of Flappy Bird In Love2D
Want to show-off your friends how good you are at flappy bird? Press 'a' during game and the game will play itself (more technically the AI Agent will play it for you - it will hit the space button (virtually) at the right time) and you act as if you are playing the game. Isn't that fun?

Press 'p' to pause the game and 'a' if you want the AI Agent to play it for you

The highscores mechanics have not been implemented yet. And I donot plan on doing that- I leave that to you ^_^
